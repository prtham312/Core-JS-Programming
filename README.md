# Core JS Programming

## Overview

This module focuses on mastering core JavaScript programming concepts along with Git version control practices. Concepts were reinforced through daily hands-on tasks, especially by working on the "Employee Wage" project to apply JS fundamentals effectively.

## Topics Covered

### JavaScript Programming

- **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**
  - Practiced JavaScript directly in the terminal or browser console for quick testing.

- **Basic Programming Constructs**
  - Understood variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and operators.

- **Methods of Primitives**
  - Worked with built-in methods for numbers, strings, and booleans.

- **Numbers and Strings**
  - Performed type conversion, parsing, formatting, and manipulation.

- **Arrays and Array Methods**
  - Learned and applied methods like:
    - `forEach()` – iterate over elements
    - `filter()` – filter items based on conditions
    - `map()` – transform array elements
    - `reduce()` – accumulate or combine values

- **Arrow Functions**
  - Used concise syntax for functions and understood lexical `this`.

- **Iterables**
  - Practiced looping with `for...of` and worked with iterable objects.

- **Map and Set**
  - Used for storing key-value pairs and unique values efficiently.

- **WeakMap and WeakSet**
  - Learned about memory-safe collections without strong references.

- **Destructuring Assignment**
  - Simplified value extraction from arrays and objects.

- **The old `var` vs `let` vs `const`**
  - Compared scoping differences and best practices for declarations.

### Git Programming

- **Branching and Merging**
  - Created and switched branches for feature development.
  - Merged changes and resolved conflicts.

- **Commits and History**
  - Made meaningful commits and maintained clean commit history.

- **Conflict Resolution**
  - Practiced resolving merge conflicts during collaborative development.

- **Feature & Version Management**
  - Followed Git workflows for managing project releases.

- **PR Workflow**
  - Understood pull request review and merging process.

- **GitBash as Client Tool**
  - Used GitBash for executing Git commands and managing repositories.

## Practice

- Implemented the **Employee Wage** problem using all major JavaScript programming concepts.
- All code was maintained and version-controlled using Git.
- Practiced regularly to build comfort with language syntax and Git operations.
